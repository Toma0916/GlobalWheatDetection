# Overview

This repository is for `Global Wheat Detection` that is Kaggle competition for detection of wheat segments in images. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/global-wheat-detection)

## Details

We implemented pipeline for object detecion by using pytorch. You can run training and inference very easily in your machines.

In our pipelinem, you can use bellow with friendly setting scheme and check result with TensorBoard.
